Use this script with caution !
Some may be old and unfinished. The others are in development so get an eye on the code
and don't use them on a production server.
I use them on Debian so no tests had been done on other distributions.

### About the clickpanic_*.sh series

# Global scripts
All scripts need clickpanic_helpers.sh so download it first and put it in /usr/local/bin.
clickpanic_completion is only useful to have completion when using scripts as command line. Just check the path at the top of the file, run clickpanic_helpers.sh to install completion then logout/in. 
clickpanic_menu.sh is a global menu for all script (in development, don't use it).

# Other scripts
After that, download one or more scripts and put it in the same directory.
Run the script with -m|--menu to have a simple select menu.
Run the script with -h|--help option to know more about available functions.

Don't hesitate to improve and adapt this code for your needs.
And share !
